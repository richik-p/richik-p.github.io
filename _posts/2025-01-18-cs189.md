## Resources for CS189: Machine Learning

Here is a list of resources I used for CS189 at UC Berkeley. I took ths class in Fall 2024. I will be updating this list if I find new resources.

- Alex Li's notes for CS189 are intuitive and well-organized. You can find them [here](https://smartspot2.github.io/assets/pdf/CS189_Lecture_Notes.pdf)
- [Notes](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/papers/machlearn.pdf) from Jonathan Shewchuk’s iteration of the course
- [Notes](https://alvinwan.com/cs189/fa16/extras/kernelized-algorithms.pdf) on Kernel Algorithms
- [Notes](https://alvinwan.com/cs189/fa16/extras/boosting.pdf) on Boosting

#### Miscellaneous

- For why PCA works well with Gaussian data, the following [StackExchange](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/25789/why-does-pca-assume-gaussian-distribution) is insightful.

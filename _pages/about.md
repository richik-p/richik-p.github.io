Hi! Iâ€™m an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley, where I am pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Neurobiology. Originally from Mumbai, India, I am passionate about high-altitude expeditions, having trekked through the Himalayas and explored distant glaciers in Greenland and volcanoes in Patagonia. My academic interests intersect at the exciting frontier of human-computer interfaces and neurobiology, particularly focusing on leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning in synthetic and developmental neurobiology to foster significant advancements in brain-computer interfaces.

When I'm not immersed in studies or research, you can find me swimming, playing tennis, or kayaking. I enjoy trying new activities and am always on the lookout for the next challenge. Always excited to connect with individuals passionate about science and technology!
